            The Calabar Carnival[1] started in 2004, when the governor of Cross
            River State, Donald Duke, had a vision of making the state a hub for
            tourism and hospitality in Nigeria and Africa.The Carnival presents
            a perfect platform from brand visibility for consumer and market
            awareness. "According to Osima-Dokubo, the carnival aimed to include
            more aspects of local heritage and culture and at the same time
            strengthen the capacity of the locals to participate in an
            economically beneficial way." Recently, Cross River State has become
            the pride of Nigeria in the areas of tourism, carnivals and
            hospitality.

            The Carnival Calabar and Festival 2017, Theme: Migration
            Migration[4] has a long history in Africa, as it has also been the
            home of many cultures for many centuries. During the era of slavery
            and colonialism, Africa was the home for many foreigners. Now it has
            become the land of opportunities.
          </p>
          <p>
            This time the world recognizes it as the new frontier, not to be
            exploited for the benefits of others but to be cultivated on its
            own. The Calabar Carnival and Festival is an opportunity to bring
            people together in going beyond tribal and religious conflicts. It
            also showcases Africa's talent and several opportunities.[5]

            The Carnival Calabar and Festival 2018 Theme "Africanism" In the
            2018 edition, making it the 15th edition since its inception in
            2004, the Cross River State Governor, Sen, Benedict Ayade introduced
            a new theme tagged "Africanism" to tell the African story from the
            African perspective; thereby bringing the global attention to the
            plight of Africa. The theme was also meant to show that Africa is
            free from Western Colonization and no longer under their political
            and economic control.[6]

            The 2019 Carnival Calabar and Festival Theme is dubbed "Humanity"
            Peaceful coexistence among humans has always been a problem from the
            beginning of time, so, the Carnival Calabar themed, "Humanity" was
            created to challenge mankind that every human being has a right to
            existence. The theme was also meant to charge mankind not to be a
            source of pain to another person's life. Apart from dancing and
            displaying the rich culture of the African people, the Carnival
            Calabar serves as an opportunity to address the world's problems, in
            which inhumanity is a part. As Governor Benedict Ayade flagged this
            year's theme - Humanity he emphasized the need for all to shun war
            as this does not depict the true personalities of those who claim
            they are humane to humanity.[7]
