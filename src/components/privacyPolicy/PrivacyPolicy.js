                How We Retain Your Personal Information
              </h4>
              <p>
                We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably
                necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including
                for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax,
                accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your
                personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or
                if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in
                respect to our relationship with you.
              </p>
              <p>
                To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data,
                we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal
                data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or
                disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we
                process your personal data and whether we can achieve those
                purposes through other means, and the applicable legal,
                regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                In some circumstances we will anonymise your personal data (so
                that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or
                statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information
                indefinitely without further notice to you.

                How We Keep Your Personal Information Secure
              </h4>
              <p>
                We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent
                your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or
                accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed.
              </p>
              <p>
                To prevent unauthorized access to your information, Journal
                Africa uses Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) to ensure secure
                transmission of your personal data. You should see the padlock
                symbol in your URL address bar once you are successfully logged
                into the platform. The URL address will also start with https://
                depicting a secure Webpage.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those
                employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have
                a business need to know. They will only process your personal
                data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of
                confidentiality.
              </p>
              <p>
                We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected
                personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable
                regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

                  Access to your personal data (commonly known as a “data
                  subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy
                  of the personal information we hold about you and check that
                  we are lawfully processing it. Please note that a data subject

                <li>
                  Erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to
                  delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason
                  for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to
                  ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have
                  successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see
                  below), where we may have processed your information
                  unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal
                  data to comply with local law. If we were not able to comply
